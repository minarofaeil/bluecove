* Build

   We are using maven2 to build project.

   Ant can be used as well but the jar created has extra classes that are not supposed to be there.

   To create Eclipse projects run:
     mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSources=true

   To run build without tests:
     mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true

   To run build without building native code:
     mvn -Dnative.build.skip=true

   build-native-bluecove.cmd and build-native-intelbth.cmd can be used to build dlls on windows.

* Building Release

    * Test locally

        mvn clean deploy site-deploy

        mvn source:jar javadoc:jar repository:bundle-create

    * Remove all -SNAPSHOT and verify version from pom.xml, BlueCoveImpl.java, build.version, common.h, bluecove.rc, intelbth.rc

    * Comment out sections marked <!--4release--> and <!--4snapshot--> in src/site/site.xml

    * SVN commit

    * run java and c/c++ build again.

    * Upload bluecove-2.X.X-bundle.jar to maven Central Repository

        http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-central-repository-upload.html

    * Build bluecove-examples project the same way. No need to Upload resulting jars! Only site.
