The list of functionality that can be implemented or investigation should be done if this is possible.

* BlueZ Linux version (C++)  (Hakan is leader here)

* Java IBM J9 MIDP
    System.setProperty
    WeakVector implementation

* OS X support. Some code exists in branches\osxPort\

* Bluetooth TOSHIBA Stack (C++)

* Complete OBEX implementation (Java)

* Security (authenticate and encrypt). (C++/Java)

* Connection timeouts. (C++/Java)

* bluecove-log4j redirection of Bluecove logs to log4j framework - separate module.
  Should be integrated in bluecove using DebugLog.LoggerAppender interface.
  Main bluecove DebugLog will try to create a class "net.sf.bluecove.log4j.LoggerAppender" during intialization adn use it if avalbe in classpath.

* bluecove-jmx monitoring of connections and other stats using JMX - separate module.
  Interfaces should be created in Main bluecove


* bluecove-emu JSR-82 emulator - separate module.
  Class should implement com.intel.bluetooth.BluetoothStack
  -Dbluecove.stack=emu
  -Dbluecove.emu=net.sf.bluecove.emu.EmulatorBluetoothStack

  Emulator can use http to connect to server this will enable web start demonstrations may be even applets (see MicroEmulator).
  Emulator can use Multicast DatagramPacket in local network to emulate Bluetooth (address assignment is a local IP address + #)
